Typical Structure of a Progress Paper

- Introduction (motivation, the new idea, summary of results)
  * 3 ways to say the same thing. It's a good way to see what they were going for

- Background Info (the current SOTA (state of the art))
  * Good to understand current SOTA, so you know where it began, so you know where it moved to
  * Important to evaluate in relation to the state of the art at the time
    * Did they go in a direction that lead to where we are today?

- Design
  * Usually the meat of the paper
  * Often the longest section, most information

- Implementation
  * They're trying to separate out what they did because they ran out of time
  * Lots of excuse-making (wanted to do x, but only got to 3/4 x)

- Evaluation
  * The authors prove that their contribution is valuable. 
  * Simulations, etc
  * "Performed as well as before, but with less heat"

- Related Work (can often ignore for a class like this)
  * Politics section
  * Distinguish themselves from similar work
  * "Standing on the shoulders of giants"

- Conclusion
