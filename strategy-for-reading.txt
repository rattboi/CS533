Treat it like an Agile software project

  - Your deliverable is your "understanding" of the paper.

  - During first sprint (5-10 minutes) develop your initial understanding. What type of paper is it? What does it contain?
    * Read abstract and conclusion
    * Quickly study all the figures/graphs
    * If time allows, read the entire introduction
    * If time allows, read the first and last paragraph of every section
    * Keep to a strict time limit (e.g. 10 minutes)
    * Put the paper away for several minutes, an hour or even a day to let you think about the paper's type, contents, contribution, etc

  - Sprint #2
    * Complete any unfinished parts of previous sprint
    * read the first sentence of every single paragraph in the paper.
    * read the entire design and implementation sections
    * Take notes as needed. Especially note things that confuse you.
    * Create a written summary of the paper for your own use
    * Time Limit: one hour. Then put the paper away, read something else, etc.

  - Sprint #3
    * Complete any unfinished parts of the previous sprint
    * Read the rest of the paper
    * Go deeper if you want/need to
      e.g. re-read sections
      e.g find related papers and materials
    * Keep each sprint time-bounded (e.g. one hour)
    * Update your written summary during/after each sprint

  - Analysis
    * Along the way you will build up an analysis
    * What was the SOTA prior to the research and how did this research advance the SOTA?
    * Are the ideas/contents of the paper relevant today? What is its importance?
    * Is the paper notable for something other than what the authors intended?
    * Does this work inspire or influence you in some way?
    * Did you find limitations, omissions or other issues with the work?
